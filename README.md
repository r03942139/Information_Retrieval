# Information_Retrieval_to_Real_World_Problems
Based on Christopher D. Manning publication "Introduction to Information Retrieval", trying to implement some algorithms for real-world problems.
Contents including: Link Analysis, Modeling and Ranking Texts, Recommendations with Implicit Feedbacks, Word Embeddings for Information Retrieval and Query Expansions.

# Project Features
* Built recommender and ranking systems on processing real world dataset from Twitter, Quizlet and Microsoft LETOR data.
* Utilized methods including Word2Vec, SVM, Matrix Factorization, Machine Learning and Data Mining.
* [Learning to Rank on Microsoft LETOR data](https://github.com/r03942139/Information_Retrieval_to_Real_World_Problems/blob/master/Link_Analysis/Link_Analysis.ipynb) was selected as top 3 solution among 95 competitors of Information Retrieval.
